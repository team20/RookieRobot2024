1. Add your code to the appropriate branch! We will be using github to collaborate on all of our code, so now's the time to get to know it! Only add to the in-progress 
branch for now.

2. General Github etiquette:
    - Just because you can doesn't mean you should... please make sure all of your contributions are meaningful and productive
    - Don't update broken code to a shared branch-- that messes with everyone who's trying to work on that branch
    - Don't edit code directly on github please. You can't test it that way and it probably won't work the first time-- see above
    - WORK TOGETHER-- if you make changes without telling anyone, their stuff will probably break and then we'll all be sad
    - Don't pull request or merge branches without talking to me(Jonathan) first
    - Thats all for now, but I might add to this list if things come up. Thanks!

## Recommended Tools

Getting Started -> https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html

Install FRC Game Tools -> https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/frc-game-tools.html


Download the ISO and install to get running(with all the toolsz).
This will install all of the tools needed to deploy robot code, including:
 1. Microsoft Visual Studio Code, i.e., everyone's favorite editor
 2. A Java Development Kit
 3. Gradle - tool that compiles the Java application then deploys it to the robot
Other tools that are helpful for development:
[Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) - Allows you to get robot code off our repository, put it on your computer for development, and push those changes back to the repository for everyone to see  

[REV Hardware Client](https://docs.revrobotics.com/rev-hardware-client/) - Not necesscary for most tasks, but useful for configuring any of the CANSparkMaxes we use  

Phoenix Tuner: [V1](https://store.ctr-electronics.com/software/) and [X](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/phoenix-tuner-x/9NVV4PWDW27Z) - also not necesscary for most tasks, but if you need to configure a CANCoder, this is the tool  

 That's it!
